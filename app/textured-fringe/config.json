        "question": "How to get a textured fringe?",
        "answer": "Getting a textured fringe is easier than you think, especially if you come prepared. \nStep 1: Bring a clear photo—use Hairstyle AI to preview the exact look. \nStep 2: Ask your stylist for a layered or \"piece-y\" fringe instead of a blunt one. \nStep 3: Make sure they cut it dry if you have wavy or curly hair—texture looks different when wet. \nStep 4: Once it's cut, use a blow dryer and a round brush to shape it, or sea salt spray for a messier look. Try our textured fringe filter first to see if this style suits your face shape perfectly!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ask for a textured fringe?",
        "answer": "When asking your barber or stylist, be direct but specific. Say something like: \"I'd love a fringe with movement and texture, nothing blunt or too heavy.\" Show them a screenshot from Hairstyle AI to remove guesswork. Mention your preferred length—eyebrows, lashes, or cheekbone level—and whether you want it full or feathered. If you have curly or fine hair, ask for a dry cut or light layering to avoid too much bulk or shrinkage. Use our textured fringe filter to visualize exactly what you want before your appointment!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What face shape suits a textured fringe?",
        "answer": "Textured fringe is super versatile and works for most face shapes—it's all about how it's styled. Oval and egg-shaped faces can wear nearly any version. Square faces do best with a soft, layered fringe that breaks up angular lines. For heart-shaped faces, a side-swept fringe helps balance a wider forehead. Long faces benefit from a thicker, eye-grazing fringe to visually shorten the face. If your face is round, go for a lifted or choppy fringe to add some edge. Try our textured fringe filter to see which style works best for your unique face shape!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a textured fringe last?",
        "answer": "A textured fringe usually holds its shape for 3 to 4 weeks before it needs a trim. Unlike blunt bangs, the layered cut grows out more naturally, often turning into curtain bangs or soft side pieces. If you're okay with a slightly longer look, you can even stretch it to 6 weeks. Just keep in mind: maintenance depends on your hair type and how precise you want it to stay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will fringe work with my curly hair?",
        "answer": "Yes—fringe can absolutely work with curly hair! In fact, textured fringes look amazing with natural curls because they enhance movement and frame the face beautifully. The key is getting the right cut. Always ask for a dry cut so the stylist can see the real curl pattern and avoid shrinkage surprises. Keep your curls hydrated with leave-in conditioner or curl cream. Try our textured fringe filter to see how different fringe styles complement your natural curls!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How to ask a barber for a textured fringe?",
        "answer": "When talking to your barber, be clear but chill. Start with, \"I'm thinking of trying a textured fringe—something layered and soft, not blunt or thick.\" Let them know your styling preferences: do you want something low-maintenance or a bit styled? Point to where you want the fringe to land (eyebrow, eye, or cheek). If possible, show a photo from Hairstyle AI—they'll instantly get your vision. Use our textured fringe filter to create the perfect reference photo for your barber!"
