      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Pompadour suitable for all face shapes and hair types?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Pompadour is versatile. It works well with most face shapes, such as oval, square, and heart-shaped faces. It can be adapted for different hair textures, including curly, straight, and wavy hair."

        "answer": "The Pompadour requires moderate maintenance to keep it looking sharp and stylish. You'll need to use a high-quality styling product, such as pomade or gel, to maintain the sleek, voluminous look. Regularly blow-drying your hair helps achieve the desired height and structure. Additionally, it's important to trim the sides and back every few weeks to preserve the clean, tapered shape."
