        "question": "Am I suitable for a man bun?",
        "answer": "Yes, most people can pull off a man bun—it all depends on your face shape, hair length, and confidence. Oval, square, and heart-shaped faces generally work best, but you can adjust bun height and tightness to flatter different features. Give it a try with the Man Bun Filter and see how you look with this timeless style!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Does a man bun cause hair loss?",
        "answer": "Man buns themselves don't cause hair loss—but wearing them too tightly for long periods can. This leads to a condition called traction alopecia, which happens when constant tension pulls on your hair roots. The good news is, it's easy to prevent. Use soft fabric hair ties, avoid tying your hair in the exact same spot every day, and let your scalp rest by keeping buns loose."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my hair isn't long enough?",
        "answer": "If your hair isn't quite long enough for a bun, don't worry—it's part of the process. Most buns need at least 6–8 inches of hair, depending on thickness and style. The awkward middle-length phase can be tough, but Hairstyle AI helps you stay motivated by showing what your future look will be like. Use clips or headbands in the meantime, and experiment with half-up styles. Seeing your goal ahead makes it easier to push through. You'll be surprised how quickly your hair grows when you're excited about what's coming."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I maintain a man bun?",
        "answer": "Maintaining a man bun is easier than you think. Start by washing your hair 2–3 times a week using gentle shampoo and conditioner to avoid drying it out. Apply leave-in conditioner or serum to control frizz and keep it healthy. Comb it back gently and tie it with a fabric or spiral hair tie to avoid damage. Trim split ends every 2–3 months to keep your hair looking fresh."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do people perceive this style socially?",
        "answer": "Perceptions of the man bun vary, but overall it's become widely accepted—especially in urban, creative, and fashion-forward communities. For many, it's a symbol of confidence, individuality, and style freedom. Of course, you may still get mixed reactions depending on your environment or industry."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the AI man bun filter change my face?",
        "answer": "No. AI man bun filter does not change your face, skin tone, or facial structure. Our tool uses facial mapping to place the hairstyle naturally over your actual features, preserving your unique look. That means no weird face reshaping or artificial editing—it's you, just with a different hairstyle. This way, you can get a realistic preview of how a man bun fits your face and head shape, helping you make confident, informed decisions. If you like what you see, you'll know it's a good match in real life too."
      },
      {
        "question": "What face shapes work best for a man bun?",
        "answer": "Man buns tend to look best on oval, square, and heart-shaped faces. These shapes balance the top-heavy volume of a bun well. If you have a long or narrow face, a low bun or loose style is better than a high tight knot, which can make your face look longer. Round faces often work with messy or off-center buns to add visual height."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to get through the awkward hair growth phase?",
        "answer": "The awkward phase is real—but manageable. Step 1: Use headbands or clips to control unruly strands. Step 2: Avoid trimming the top—focus on shaping the sides if needed. Step 3: Keep your hair moisturized to reduce frizz and dryness. Step 4: Try temporary styles like half buns or low knots."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a man bun hard to manage?",
        "answer": "Not at all. Once your hair reaches the right length, a man bun can actually be one of the easiest styles to maintain. Just tie it back and you're good to go. It's great for workouts, hot days, or casual looks. You don't need fancy tools—just a good tie, occasional wash days, and basic trimming. Some users even say it's easier than managing short styles because there's less daily styling required. Want to try it out? Use the Man Bun Filter to see how you’d look with this hassle-free yet stylish look!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I tie a bun if I have damaged or thin hair?",
        "answer": "Yes, but you need to be gentle. For damaged or thinning hair, avoid tight buns and heavy styling products. Instead, go for looser buns or half-up styles that reduce tension on your scalp. Use soft ties, and don't pull your hair too tightly when tying it up. The right style can even help mask thinning areas. Want to see how a man bun looks on you? Try out the Man Bun Filter and find the perfect fit for your style!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I be judged as too feminine?",
        "answer": "The man bun used to spark debate—but times have changed. Today, it's seen more as a symbol of confidence and self-expression than anything else. Whether you're into streetwear, fashion, or just want a clean, tied-up look, a man bun fits right in. If you're worried about perception, start with a subtle low bun or pair it with a fade."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to tie a man bun?",
        "answer": "Step-by-step: 1. Brush your hair back—use a comb to smooth out tangles. 2. Gather your hair at the crown or back of your head. 3. Twist it into a circular bun shape using both hands. 4. Secure with a soft elastic band—avoid anything too tight or rough. 5. Adjust for comfort—loosen strands slightly or leave some hair out for a messy effect. This works for medium to long hair. For shorter hair, try a half bun or use pins for support."
