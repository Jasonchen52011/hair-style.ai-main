      {
        "question": "Why is the float test for hair porosity unreliable?",
        "answer": "The float test is unreliable because it doesn't reflect how your hair behaves in real conditions. It only checks if a hair strand sinks in water, which can be affected by product buildup, water temperature, or hair that's not freshly washed. Hair porosity depends on your hair's cuticle layer and how well it absorbs moisture—not how it floats. People with the same porosity might get different results from this test. That's why we don't use it. Our hair type identifier uses multi-factor image analysis to assess porosity, texture, thickness, and curl pattern with much more accuracy and consistency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does my hair type change over time due to age, environment, or hormones?",
        "answer": "Yes, your hair type can change over time. Hair is influenced by age, hormones, environment, and even stress. For example, pregnancy or menopause can make your hair thinner or curlier. Moving to a humid or dry climate might change how your hair behaves daily. Damage from heat styling or chemical treatments can also shift your texture. That's why your hair might feel or look different than it used to. I used to have fine, straight hair in college, and now it's slightly wavy and thicker. This is totally normal—and why regular re-checks are helpful!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I wash my hair?",
        "answer": "It depends on your hair type and lifestyle. Straight or oily hair might need washing every 1-2 days, while curly or coily hair can go 5-7 days or even longer. If you exercise often or live somewhere humid, you might need to wash more. But overwashing can strip your scalp of natural oils and make dryness worse. For example, I have wavy hair and found that washing twice a week keeps it clean but not frizzy. The key is to find a routine that matches your hair type and how your scalp feels."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I find a good hairdresser?",
        "answer": "Here's a step-by-step guide to finding a great hairdresser: Step 1: Ask friends with similar hair types for recommendations. Step 2: Check online reviews on Google or Yelp, but focus on people who mention your hair texture. Step 3: Browse the salon or stylist's Instagram. Look for before-and-after pictures of hair similar to yours. Step 4: Book a quick consultation first. A good stylist will listen to your concerns and explain their approach. Step 5: Start small—maybe a trim or styling session—before committing to a big haircut or color."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to determine your hair type",
        "answer": "Step 1: Wash your hair and let it air dry without adding any products. Step 2: Look at the shape of your strands. Are they straight, wavy, curly, or coily? Step 3: Examine your hair's thickness. Is each strand fine, medium, or coarse? Step 4: Check your density—how much hair you have overall. Step 5: Test porosity by seeing how quickly your hair dries. Or skip all that and upload a photo into our AI hair type identifier. It does this whole routine for you, instantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is hair type 1b?",
        "answer": "Hair type 1B is mostly straight but has a slight wave or bend. It's not pin-straight like 1A, and it's not wavy enough to be type 2. 1B hair has more body and volume than 1A, and it can hold styles better, though it still tends to get oily quickly. Many people with 1B hair notice that their hair looks straight when dry but puffs slightly with humidity. I've had clients with 1B hair think it was totally straight until they let it air dry—then those bends show up."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does type 2 hair look like?",
        "answer": "Type 2 hair is wavy, shaped like the letter S. It's not curly but not straight either. Type 2 is broken into three subtypes: 2A has loose, subtle waves, often with fine strands; 2B has more defined waves that start midway; 2C has thick, coarse waves that can look like loose curls. Type 2 hair often struggles with frizz and can lose wave definition if it's weighed down by heavy products. I think it's the most versatile type—easy to straighten or curl depending on your mood."

        "question": "What does type 3c hair look like?",
        "answer": "Type 3C hair is tightly curled, with well-defined, springy ringlets. The curls are usually the size of a pencil or straw. It tends to be dense, voluminous, and can shrink a lot when dry. 3C hair is beautiful but needs lots of moisture to stay healthy. Without proper care, it can become frizzy or dry fast. A leave-in conditioner and curl-defining cream work wonders here. I have a friend with 3C curls, and every time she follows her full routine, the definition is out of this world."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is type B hair?",
        "answer": "Type B hair isn't a standard classification on its own. It's likely you're referring to hair types like 1B, 2B, 3B, or 4B—each combining texture and curl pattern. The B in these types tells you how tight or loose the curl or wave is within that texture group. For example, 2B is wavy with medium definition, while 3B is curly with more bounce. If someone says type B hair, it's best to clarify which number comes before the B to understand the texture better."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to classify hair type",
        "answer": "Step 1: Start with the curl pattern. Is it straight (1), wavy (2), curly (3), or coily (4)? Step 2: Identify the subtype—A, B, or C—based on how tight or loose the pattern is. Step 3: Consider other features like porosity, strand thickness, and density. Step 4: Check if your hair behaves differently in different weather or seasons. Step 5: If this feels confusing, use a hair type identifier app. It classifies everything for you—fast and accurately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to tell what type your hair is",
        "answer": "Step 1: Let your hair air dry after washing without using products. Step 2: Look in the mirror. Is your hair completely straight, gently wavy, curly, or very tightly coiled? Step 3: Pull a strand. Is it fine, medium, or thick? Step 4: Run your fingers through. Do you feel lots of hair (dense) or less (thin)? Step 5: Use a hair type quiz or AI tool to confirm. I thought my hair was straight until I tried the quiz—it was actually 2A wavy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I figure out what hair type I have?",
        "answer": "Start by paying attention to what your hair looks and feels like when it's clean and dry without products. If it falls flat and straight, you're likely type 1. If it bends slightly or forms waves, it's type 2. Defined curls mean type 3, and tight coils are type 4. From there, subtypes A, B, or C reflect how loose or tight the shape is. Don't forget: your hair might not fit one box exactly. That's where a hair type identifier by photo really helps—no guessing required."
