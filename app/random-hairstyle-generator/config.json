To avoid this, always bring clear visual references—photos or videos of the style you desire. Make sure to discuss your hair texture and what maintenance you're willing to do at home. It's also helpful to talk about how much time you can spend on styling each day. A good stylist will guide you to a style that matches your vision and is manageable for your lifestyle."

      "content": "\"Why is my hair getting so dry and brittle?\" is a question many of us ask after experiencing poor hair health. Taking care of your hair requires more than just shampoo. Regular use of the right hair products for your type—whether it's dry, oily, or curly—will make a huge difference. Don't forget about hydration, both from the inside out and through the products you use. If you notice significant changes in hair texture or scalp health, it might be time for a professional consultation. Protecting your hair from heat damage and environmental stressors can also greatly improve its quality over time."

      "answer": "To determine your hair porosity, follow these steps:\n1. Take a strand of clean, dry hair and place it in a glass of water.\n2. Observe how your hair behaves in the water:\n    • If it sinks quickly, you have high porosity.\n    • If it floats, you have low porosity.\n    • If it floats but slowly sinks, you have normal porosity.\nUnderstanding your hair's porosity helps you choose the best products and treatments for your hair type, ensuring your style stays healthy and manageable."

      "question": "How to communicate with my hairstylist?",

Use photos or videos as visual references.\n2. Share your hair texture and any concerns about maintaining the style.\n3.

Good communication ensures you get a style that suits you and fits your daily routine perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does hair quality change over time?",
      "answer": "Yes, hair quality can change over time due to factors like age, diet, lifestyle, and hair care habits. As we age, hair tends to lose thickness and shine. Hormonal changes, stress, and environmental factors like pollution or sun exposure can also affect hair quality. Regular use of the right hair care products, a balanced diet, and protective styling can help improve and maintain hair health. If you notice changes in texture or volume, it's a good idea to consult a stylist for advice on treatments that suit your hair's current condition."
