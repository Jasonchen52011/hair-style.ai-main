    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do I choose the right hairstyle for me?",
        "answer": "To choose the right hairstyle for you, follow these simple steps: Step 1: Identify your face shape—round, oval, square, heart, or diamond. Step 2: Check your hair texture—is it straight, wavy, curly, or coily? Step 3: Think about how much time you want to spend styling it. Step 4: Take a haircut quiz like ours for expert-backed suggestions. Step 5: Bring example photos to your barber or stylist so they understand your goal. It's all about finding a look that fits your real life, not just your Pinterest board."
      },
      {
        "question": "What hairstyle will make my face look slimmer?",
        "answer": "Layered cuts that add volume to the top and avoid too much width at the sides tend to slim down round or fuller faces. Long layers, side-swept bangs, and high ponytails are often great options. Avoid blunt cuts that stop at the cheeks or jawline—they can make your face look wider. Also, volume at the crown helps elongate your head shape, which creates a more balanced and slimmer look."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does shaving your head make your hair grow thicker and faster?",
        "answer": "This is a common myth. Shaving your head does not affect how fast or thick your hair grows. Hair growth happens from the follicle underneath your scalp, not from the ends. When hair is shaved, it may appear thicker at first because it grows back with a blunt tip, but the actual texture and growth rate stay the same. Genetics and health play a bigger role in hair thickness and speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I communicate my needs with my hairstylist?",
        "answer": "Step 1: Bring reference photos of styles you like and explain what you like about them. Step 2: Talk about your daily routine—do you have time to style your hair every day or need something low-maintenance? Step 3: Be honest about your hair history—chemical treatments, color, etc. Step 4: Ask questions like, \"Will this cut work for my face shape?\" or \"How often will I need trims?\" Good communication helps avoid post-haircut regret and builds trust with your stylist."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the worst haircut you've ever had?",
        "answer": "The worst haircut is usually one that didn't match the person's face shape or lifestyle—and no one gave them a heads-up. A lot of people regret overly short bangs or super blunt cuts that didn't grow out well. One common story? Someone asks for a \"trim\" and ends up losing six inches. That's why using a tool like ours helps you go into the salon with a plan, not a guess."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I manage the in-between phase when growing out a haircut?",
        "answer": "Step 1: Use accessories like clips, hats, or headbands to deal with awkward lengths. Step 2: Ask your stylist for a \"shaping\" cut to help the hair grow in a better form. Step 3: Use styling products like mousse or pomade to add volume or smooth frizz. Step 4: Don't skip trims—removing split ends makes hair look neater and helps it grow better. Step 5: Be patient and experiment with styles like buns or braids to stay fresh while you grow it out."

Step 2: Check your hair texture—is it straight, wavy, curly, or coily? Step 3: Think about how much time you want to spend styling it. Step 4: Take a haircut quiz like ours for expert-backed suggestions. Step 5: Bring example photos to your barber or stylist so they understand your goal."

            "text": "Layered cuts that add volume to the top and avoid too much width at the sides tend to slim down round or fuller faces. Long layers, side-swept bangs, and high ponytails are often great options. Avoid blunt cuts that stop at the cheeks or jawline—they can make your face look wider."

Step 2: Talk about your daily routine—do you have time to style your hair every day or need something low-maintenance? Step 3: Be honest about your hair history—chemical treatments, color, etc. Step 4: Ask questions like, \"Will this cut work for my face shape?\" or \"How often will I need trims?\""
