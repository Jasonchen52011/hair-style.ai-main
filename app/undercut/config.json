        "question": "Will an Undercut reduce bulk?",
        "answer": "Yes, an undercut haircut is perfect if you're looking to reduce hair volume. By shaving or trimming the sides or back, it removes bulk and makes your hair feel lighter—especially helpful for thick or heavy hair. It's a great way to keep your style cool and manageable."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is an Undercut?",
        "answer": "An undercut is a haircut where the sides or back are shaved or clipped short while the top is left longer. It creates a bold contrast and works with many styles—fade, curly, long, or disconnected. It's trendy, edgy, and super customizable for both men and women."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Undercut good for women too?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! The undercut women trend is huge. It's a stylish, confident look that works with all hair lengths—pixie, bob, long layers. You can keep it subtle or go bold with shaved designs. It's not just a guy thing anymore. Many girls love the freedom and edge it brings."
