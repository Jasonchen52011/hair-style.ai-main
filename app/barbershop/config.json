You can use it as much as you want, whether you're trying new looks for clients before their haircut or just exploring styles yourself. It runs directly in your browser, with no app to download. Many barbers use it in their shop as a quick conversation tool before appointments. No paywalls. No restrictions. Just upload, explore, and save what you like. That's how we designed it—easy, open, and helpful for every barber or customer."
      },
      {
        "question": "How realistic are the results?",
        "answer": "The results are surprisingly realistic—clients often think it's an actual haircut photo. We use advanced AI face detection to match lighting, angles, and style proportions. It simulates real hairstyles, textures, and colors without looking fake or over-edited. You'll see natural transitions in the hairline, shadows, and edges. This helps barbers build trust and lets customers preview their new look with confidence. Honestly, I've shown previews to clients who said, \"Wait, is that already me?\" That's the level of realism we aim for."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of photo works best?",
        "answer": "You'll get the best results with a front-facing photo where the client is looking straight at the camera. Make sure their hair is pulled back or not blocking the face. Avoid hats, sunglasses, or heavy shadows. Natural daylight works great, and neutral backgrounds help the AI focus on the face. If possible, have the person relax and smile—expressions matter too! The clearer the image, the better the AI can map the face shape and apply the hairstyle precisely. Think of it like a passport photo but more relaxed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I try beard styles too?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Hairstyle AI includes beard previews—everything from light stubble to a full fade + beard combo. If your client is unsure whether to go clean-shaven, tapered, or bold with a thick beard, this helps them visualize the change. I've had guys try a beard style virtually and instantly commit. It's also great for barbers who offer full grooming services. You can show them a full head-to-beard makeover and even suggest trims they didn't think about. It's a simple way to upsell grooming without the hard sell."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my photo and data private?",
        "answer": "Your privacy is our top priority. Hairstyle AI does not store your photos or data. All images are processed instantly and then deleted. We don't collect user information, track sessions, or sell anything to third parties. You don't need to make an account or share personal info. We built it this way so barbers and clients can feel 100% safe. I personally never use tools that save client photos without permission—so I made sure ours doesn't. No nonsense, no leaks. Just style previews and peace of mind."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the AI suggest styles for my face shape?",
        "answer": "Yes. Hairstyle AI is powered by a built-in face shape analyzer that detects the contour of your face and jawline. Based on that, it recommends styles—like layered cuts for oval faces, shorter trims for round faces, or fade variations for angular jaws. It doesn't just overlay styles randomly. It actually considers structure, balance, and forehead proportions. This is one reason I recommend this tool to every barber. It takes the guesswork out of \"what would look good on me?\" and turns it into a quick, visual decision."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to get results?",
        "answer": "It usually takes less than 10 seconds after uploading a photo. Once the image is analyzed, you can swipe through all available hairstyles instantly. There's no waiting, no loading bars, and no annoying ads. Just tap, swipe, and see results. You can switch styles, try new colors, and go back to your favorites—all within seconds. For barbers working with busy clients, this makes it perfect to use during a consultation. I use it while clients are in the chair—it never slows us down."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I share my new style with others?",
        "answer": "Yes! Once you've picked a look you love, just tap the \"Download\" button to save it to your device. From there, you can post it to Instagram, drop it into a text, or even use it in your barbershop's gallery. Some clients use it to ask friends for opinions before the cut, while others love posting a side-by-side comparison online. It's also great for barbershop social media—create polls, styling options, or before/after stories. One client of mine went viral with a \"Which one?\" hairstyle post. No joke."
