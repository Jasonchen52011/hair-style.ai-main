        "answer": "While dyeing hair red can cause some dryness or damage over time, it doesn't have to be severe if you take proper care of your hair.

        "answer": "No, there is no conclusive evidence that dyeing your hair red—or any other color—directly causes cancer. However, some hair dyes contain chemicals that can irritate your skin or hair, so it's always a good idea to choose ammonia-free or natural dyes and follow the instructions carefully. If you have concerns about hair dye, trying a virtual red hair transformation with the Red Hair Filter is a safe and risk-free way to explore the color."

      },
      {
        "question": "How to Maintain Red Hair Color After Dyeing?",
        "answer": "Maintaining red hair color can be tricky since red shades tend to fade quickly. After dyeing, use sulfate-free shampoo and avoid washing your hair with hot water. To keep your hair vibrant, use deep conditioning treatments once a week to lock in moisture and prevent color fading. You can also try the Red Hair Filter to test how your hair would look with different shades of red before dyeing it!"

        "question": "What Hair Color Looks Best on Me?",
        "answer": "The best hair color for you depends on your skin tone, eye color, and personal style. For fair skin, red tones like ginger and strawberry blonde are great. For medium or olive skin, shades like auburn or copper bring out the natural warmth of your complexion. Dark skin tones can pull off deep reds like burgundy or wine red. Use Hairstyle AI's Red Hair Filter to experiment with different colors and find the perfect shade for you!"
