    {
      "question": "What are the typical types of buzz cuts?",
      "answer": "Buzz cuts come in different styles like the classic uniform buzz, fade buzz, crew cut, high and tight, and burr cut. Each type offers a different level of sharpness, texture, and face exposure depending on your style and comfort."
    },
    {
      "question": "What would I look like with a buzz cut?",
      "answer": "A buzz cut is bold and minimal, often making your face, eyes, and jawline stand out more. You can use Hairstyle AI to preview your buzz cut virtually and see exactly how it would look—realistic, easy, and no haircut needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best apps for buzz cut filters?",
      "answer": "The best buzz cut filter apps include Hairstyle AI, Fotor, and YouCam Makeup. Hairstyle AI is especially popular for its realistic results, wide style selection, and privacy-first design. It's fast, free, and doesn't require sign-up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is a buzz cut right for my face shape?",
      "answer": "Buzz cuts generally suit oval, square, and long face shapes. They highlight the bone structure and jawline. If you're unsure, use Hairstyle AI to try different buzz cuts on your own face and find what flatters you best."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I regret getting a buzz cut? How do I survive the awkward phase?",
      "answer": "If you regret it, don't worry—hair grows back fast. Use hats, headbands, or try styling products to control growth. The awkward phase usually lasts 2-4 weeks. Stay confident, and consider it a bold reset for your next look."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long are #1, #2, and #3 buzz cuts?",
      "answer": "A #1 buzz cut is about 1/8 inch (3mm), #2 is 1/4 inch (6mm), and #3 is 3/8 inch (10mm). The higher the number, the longer the cut—great for adjusting how bold or soft you want the look."
    },

      "question": "Is Hairstyle AI's simulation realistic?",
      "answer": "Hairstyle AI uses advanced face mapping and lighting adjustments to deliver ultra-realistic results. It blends the buzz cut seamlessly with your head shape and facial features, so the final image looks like a real photo, not a filter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the pros and cons of getting a buzz cut?",
      "answer": "Buzz cuts are low-maintenance, stylish, and perfect for hot weather or active lifestyles. However, they can make scalp shape more visible and aren't ideal for covering uneven areas or thinning hair. Always try virtually first to decide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the hairstyle try-on tool free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Hairstyle AI is completely free to try. You can test up to five different hairstyles every day without paying or creating an account. No commitment, no subscription—just fast, fun, and easy virtual try-ons."
