For instance, round or oval faces usually rock box braids and cornrows. Braids also work differently depending on your hair type and density—fine hair might feel heavy with thick braids, while curly, thick, or afro-textured hair thrives in protective braids like dreadlocks or fishtail braids.",

      "Braided hair looks sleek and stunning—but it needs care to stay fresh! Start by trimming the ends of your braided hair every 6–8 weeks, depending on the style, to prevent fraying and maintain a crisp look. Use a lightweight, sulfate-free shampoo and a smoothing conditioner to tame frizz, perfect for wavy, curly, or afro-textured hair.",
      "Can you air-dry your braided hair? Absolutely, especially for straight or lightly wavy hair, which dries naturally with minimal frizz. For thicker or afro-textured hair, air-drying may take longer, so a low-heat blow-dry with a diffuser can reduce frizz and ensure your braided hair looks polished. Always use a heat protectant spray when styling with heat!",
      "Concerned your braided hair might look too simple? Elevate it with accessories like beads or cuffs, or experiment with vibrant colors like ombre or pastel shades. These touches can make your braided hair stylish, expressive, or boldly unique. Want to preview your look first? Try the AI Braids Filter from Hairstyle AI to test box braids, faux locs, or colorful patterns risk-free before committing."

    },
    {
      "question": "How long do braided hair last and when will my hair grow back?",
      "answer": "Braided hair usually last 4 to 8 weeks depending on care and style. Your natural hair grows about ½ inch per month, so after removing the braids, you'll likely see noticeable growth. Just remember to moisturize and avoid pulling too tightly during the grow-out phase."
    },
