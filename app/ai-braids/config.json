For instance, round or oval faces usually rock box braids and cornrows. Braids also work differently depending on your hair type and density—fine hair might feel heavy with thick braids, while curly, thick, or afro-textured hair thrives in protective braids like dreadlocks or fishtail braids.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How realistic is the AI Braids Filter?",
      "answer": "The AI Braids Filter is powered by smart face-mapping technology. It detects your hairline, skull shape, lighting, and face angle to place braids where they would naturally fall. The result looks incredibly real — like a virtual salon try-on that's photo-ready."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it for all genders and ages?",
      "answer": "Yes. Hairstyle AI is built for everyone — women, men, non-binary, and all gender expressions. Whether you're 16 or 60, as long as your face is clear and visible in the photo, our AI will create a custom braid look that fits your unique features."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is AI Braids Filter free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Hairstyle AI is completely free to use. You get 5 braid style tries per day at no cost. No sign-up, no subscription, no app to download. It's the easiest and most budget-friendly way to test new hairstyles online."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I try other hairstyles too?",
      "answer": "Yes！ Hairstyle AI isn't just about braids. You can also explore short cuts, fades, long styles, and trendy looks — all in one place. Just upload your photo once and switch between styles anytime to find what really suits you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have thin or unique hair? Can AI still match it?",
      "answer": "Yes. The AI doesn't rely on your real hair texture. Instead, it uses your face shape and scalp area to place the braid style. Whether your hair is thin, curly, or afro-textured, the filter adjusts automatically to create a realistic and flattering fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is it with skull shape and hairline?",
      "answer": "Very accurate. Our AI maps your face landmarks, including your hairline, cheekbones, and forehead shape. That's why braids appear naturally placed—even around uneven or unique hairlines. The result is a look that feels tailored to your actual head shape."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are braids protective hairstyles?",
      "answer": "Yes, braids are considered a protective hairstyle. They help reduce hair breakage, limit daily manipulation, and keep moisture sealed in. Many people with textured or curly hair choose braids to support healthy hair growth while staying stylish."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do braids last and when will my hair grow back?",
      "answer": "Braids usually last 4 to 8 weeks depending on care and style. Your natural hair grows about ½ inch per month, so after removing the braids, you'll likely see noticeable growth. Just remember to moisturize and avoid pulling too tightly during the grow-out phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does 'AI Braids' mean anything else?",
      "answer": "Yes. \"AI Braids\" might also remind people of NBA star Allen Iverson's iconic cornrows or even AI-based software used in other industries."
