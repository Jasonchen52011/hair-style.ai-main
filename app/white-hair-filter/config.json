        "question": "How to keep white hair white?",
        "answer": "To maintain bright, white hair, you'll need to protect it from yellowing. Use a purple shampoo to neutralize brassiness and keep your white hair looking fresh. Deep condition regularly to keep your hair hydrated and prevent dryness. Also, avoid excessive sun exposure and heat styling, as these can cause fading."
      },
      {
        "question": "What race has white hair?",
        "answer": "White hair is typically associated with aging, and it can appear in people of all races. Some individuals may start to go gray or white in their early adulthood, while others may retain their natural color longer. It's all about genetics—everyone's hair eventually loses pigment over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my hair going white instead of grey?",
        "answer": "Your hair turns white when the pigment-producing cells in your hair follicles stop producing melanin, the natural pigment responsible for hair color. This can happen more quickly for some people, resulting in white hair instead of gray. Genetics play a significant role in determining when and how quickly this process happens."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to get completely white hair?",
        "answer": "Getting completely white hair typically involves bleaching your hair to remove all natural pigment. It's a complex process, so it's best to seek professional help to avoid damage. Once your hair is fully bleached, you can maintain it with the right hair care products designed for white or platinum hair."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to get white-grey hair?",
        "answer": "White-grey hair is a popular style for those who want a mix of silver and white tones. To achieve this look, you can lighten your hair to a pale silver or cool blonde shade. Regular use of purple shampoo helps maintain the cool tones and prevents any yellowing."
      },

        "question": "What hair color looks best on me?",
        "answer": "Finding the best hair color for you depends on your skin tone and personal style. Cool-toned colors like platinum work great for fair skin, while warm tones like honey blonde suit medium skin. If you have dark skin, bold colors like deep auburn or rich browns can complement your complexion beautifully. The White Hair Filter can help you experiment and find your perfect shade!"

        "question": "How to transition from black to grey hair seamlessly?",
        "answer": "Transitioning from black hair to grey is a gradual process that can be done in several ways. You can either go for highlights or lowlights to blend in the gray gradually, or allow your natural gray to grow in. The key is patience! You can try out your new grey look using the White Hair Filter to see how it will look before making any changes."
